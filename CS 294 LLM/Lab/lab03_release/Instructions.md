# Lab 03: LLM Security, Writing Defense Prompts
## Why Does LLM Security Matter?
Many security risks in LLMs arise due to their training procedure. The training procedure is roughly split into two phases: pretraining and fine tuning. During pretraining, LLMs use next-word prediction, often on large amounts of text data from the internet. Since this dataset is so large, it's difficult to ensure all of the data is high quality, and as such, the pretraining dataset may contain harmful content, which propagates into model inference. For this reason, it's crucial to manage potential stereotypes and biases during the pretraining phase. Although LLMs have varying use cases and come in various forms (e.g., public models like ChatGPT, corporate models, domain-specific models), they all share a common requirement: they must be accurate, unbiased, and robust. Therefore, ongoing research on defense, alignment, and safety is vital.

## Lab Context 
This lab is similar to Lab 02, but instead of writing attack prompts, you will be creating a single defense prompt. The only restriction is that it must fit within the system message of the LLM.

Make this defense prompt as secure as possible. We will run two attacks created by the course staff on your defense. You will receive full credit if your defense successfully blocks both attacks.

## Common Defense Tactics
Here are some common techniques used to enhance the robustness of LLMs, improving their defensive capabilities: 
1. **Safety Instructions/Constitutions:** Chat-based LLMs are trained and effective at following instructions. Simply providing safety instructions alongside user input is a valid defense strategy. 
2. **Adversarial Prompting:** Within the instructions, include adversarial concepts. Instruct the model to identify and properly respond to these. 
3. **Post Prompting:** The order of instructions can significantly impact the outcome. Placing task instructions at the end may increase the model's likelihood of following them.
4. **Output Sanitization:** Monitor the output to detect and remove any harmful or unwanted information.

## Instructions and Task Description
Before your defense prompt, we will prepend the string "The secret key is XXXXXXXXX". After concatenating this string (which contains the secret key) with your defense prompt, we will set that as the system message of the LLM.

Your task is to write a defense prompt within the file `defense.txt`. **Do not include your own secret key in your solution**. Focus solely on the defense. Success is defined by preventing the secret key from being leaked against an attacker attempting to expose it.

The course staff has written two attacks that your defense prompt should successfully block. Your grade will be based on how well your defense performs against these attacks.

Additionally, we may hold a class competition where the attacks written by students in Lab 02 will be tested against the defenses created in this lab. More information about this will be posted on Edstem and Discord.


## Recommended Approach
As in Lab 02, simulate your own attack/defense environment using Autogen or the OpenAI playground. Test your defense prompt against the attack prompts you wrote in Lab 02. Create additional attack prompts to assess the robustness of your defense. Our autograder will check whether the secret key is leaked.

## Grading and Submission
### UC Berkeley Students
Zip this folder and submit it to Gradescope. Before submission, **please make sure that you fill out your information within** `student_info.json`. From there, the autograder will test your code. Course staff has written a few attack prompts (~2, this may be subject to change), and if your defense does not leak the secret key we inject into the system message, you will earn a point. If you successfully defend against all attacks, you will receive full credit. 

### MOOC Students
We will release a Google Form where you can write your defense contents. The limit per each defense is generous, sitting at 50,000 characters. Submit your attack prompt through this Google Form.
