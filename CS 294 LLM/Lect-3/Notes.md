#  Agentic AI frameworks and AutoGen
Chi wang

## Agentic Ai frameworks
### Future:
- Generative: generate text & image
- Agentic: execute complex tasks
  - Examples: personal assistant, robots, game agents, etc. 

### Agentic Example: Hugging face model platform
- understand the problem, breakdown tasks, creating files, develop websites, building and compiling,  all tasks done automatically
- if critical lines are deleted, hit some error when building. Then coding the removed line and succeed.

### Key benefits:
 - useful interface
- strong capability
- **useful architecture: using <u>*multi agents*</u> recursively**.
   - GPT can't answer because they do not know the bg
   - e.g. Commander agent gives programming commands to other agents, Writer agent wrote code,  Safety agent check security.

### Agentic Design Patterns
- conversation
- prompting
- tool use
- integrating multiple models, modalities, and memories
- AutoGen(multi-agent conversation programming), ...


## AutoGen
1. Define the agent, wrapping up all inner agents and giving the user one interface to chat.
    - Nested chat?
2. get them to talk
