## Tell me a bit about yourself
I am a Computer Science master student from UC Berkeley, currently I am working on developing machine learning algorithms for robot manipulation. That's what I did in the past 7 years since participating FIRST Tech Challenge in high school in 2017. I really like every moment creating robots and programs with my team, and I have been learning a **lot** from them. And most importantly, I enjoy exploring every new stuff . I am passionate about doing impactful tasks and solving complex and challenging engineering problems.
