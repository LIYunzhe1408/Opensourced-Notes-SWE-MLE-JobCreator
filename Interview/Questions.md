## Tell me a little about yourself.
Hi xx, I'm Jonas, a master student in EECS from UC Berkeley. My interest is computer vision and machine learning within Robotics and 
autonomous vehicles. Over the past 7 years, as a team lead and a computer vision engineer, I’ve developed computer vision systems for mobile robots, 
working under real-time and complex scenarios.  Besides that, I have conducted research using machine learning in field of battery and computer vision 
explanability, these are two parts also important to make a decision and choose a energy source for a intelligent agent. Before graduation from undergrad, 
based on my combination background of technology and team lead experience, I got a position as a product manager in Momenta. I really like every moment creating 
robots and programs with my team and bring innovative ideas to the real world. The position as a perception sw engineer at Cepton exactly align with my interest and 
career plan, so I think it would be a great fit into this position.


## Why [Company]?
[Experience using their product, I like... -> Tech -> experience overlap with job responsibility -> motivated -> current challenge -> solve it make more value -> personal growth]  

As a product manager at Momenta, we greatly depend on the 3D point cloud from lidar for detection and sensor fusion, then a make a better decision, So key point for intelligent agent
-> when I notice this position, my experience, skillset overlap with the job responsibility -> Noticed that Cepton is making autonomous driving safe for everyone. 
The hazard detection lidar technology can be integrated into all vehicles, creating safer roads. and potential for applications. -> Further, I can achieve growth and make contributions.

## Customer Obsession
Have you ever solved problems for customers? How you find the problem? What's the feedback? How you communicate?
1. Make a suggestion for clients, prioritize the needs
2. Describe a difficult interaction you had with your client.

[How you navigate the problem? -> Generate a plan -> Actions -> Results]
When I was xxxx, we were approaching an important regional competition, we could image that we had to deal with multiple integrations for stability. We have a conflict about priority of the task.
The CV Lead said they were almost there to develop powerful features and shoot the target accurately, while I estimate they will spend much more time to deploy, and we will have little time for stability test.
My plan was simple, I gave computer vision members 3 days to release an MVP, if they can do that, then I will let them deploy on all robots, if not, their feature will not be developed further, and all time will be allocated to stability test.
Finally, they didn't do that in 3 days, and stability tests were fully implemented and several bugs were fixed. As a result, we won the 3rd place in the tournament and even completely defeat those teams having computer vision system but not stable.

When I was interned in ..., we were at the beginning of the new milestone, and negotiating the goals and deliverables with the client. As a product manager,
I had to communicate with our R&D team, road test team, VP, and vehicle coordinators to scope our deliverables nad also understand the features they want to build.
It was challenging because, you know, customers always wants a million things that they wanna do 2x numbers of road test cases for a newly proposed feature, 
and there's a finite amount of resources and time that we can allocate. My plan was to go ahead and helped the customer understand and prioritize the feasibility of the newly-proposed 
features and the stability of generalization feature for delivery.

## Leaders are right, a lot
1. Tell me a time you made a mistake in judgment made a bad decision.
When I was the team lead in a robotics team, I realize the drone or the aerial robot will be essential for us. I recruited a member who showed several profolio about drones in his
previous experience and was recommended a professor. As he was a phD and I had to coordinate resources for other robots, I let him develop by himself and check his progress once a week.
Though he showed me the code and the his future plan, I didn't see the drone fly even once before the competition. $3,000 were invested for him, but nothing was progressed.
From this failure, I realized that every project should have a quantified outcome for several stages, like OKR, and checked the difference between objectives and the actual progress. Then 
decide whether I want to push this further. As a result, in the next season, I optimized this and better coordinate the funding.

## Ownership
1. Tell me about a time when you took responsibility outside of your role.
When I Interned..., my mentor and I need to deliver a simulation report once a week. Previously, it was calculated manually by product manager based on generated data. However, 
I found it was time-consuming and errors commonly took place. As the data was in the structure, I wrote a proposal describing the problem, solution, timeline, and expected outcome, 
then proposed it to my mentor and my line manager. To ensure we can deliver this week, I manually calculated it along with developing automation library using Python. I tested it using data
in the last year to test its performance. I found it will be limited to some specific scenarios and optimized it to be more scalable. After showing this to my mentor and line manager, they were
impressed and wrap my code to the R&D team to integrate it as a tool for internal use, saving 90% time for PM and ensure the accurate calculation.

## Tell me about a time when you have a Challenge
[exp]
We were onboarding one of the largest clients, we could image at that time we had to deal with multiple integrations and work with a team, at that time they were [challenge]
I was the lead engineer, I had to communicate with our internal product team to scope our deliverables and also understand the features the customer wanted us to build. 
It was challenging because, you know, customers they always want a million things, and there's a finite amount of resources that we can allocate and work on those features.
So my plan was simple, I went ahead and helped the customer understand and prioritize the features so they can come up with a feasible MVP, and set a reasonable timeline for delivery.
And then we can iterate and build more features after that.
In the end, we were able to deliver the project a week earlier than we originally planned for and the MVP was a success. We were able to scope the next version of the product with the customer and eventually build a very productive working relationship with them.
