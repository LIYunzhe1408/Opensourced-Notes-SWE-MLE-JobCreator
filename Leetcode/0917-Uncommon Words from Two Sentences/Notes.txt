Thoughts:
Use hashmap or equivalent structures to record number of appearences.

New data structure in python:
collections.Counter([list]): dict subclass for counting hashable objects


Solution1: not time efficient, not space efficient
1. Choose a data structure to contain data. List is okay, but search will be O(n)
2. Split two sentences into two separate ones.
3. Traverse one sentence s1
4. Traverse the other sentence s2
5. Traverse hashmap and choose the ones with value of 1.

Optimized Solution1: not time efficient
1. Choose a data structure to contain data. List is okay, but search will be O(n)
2. Split two sentences into two separate ones and extend into 1.
3. Traverse the extended sentence
5. Traverse hashmap and choose the ones with value of 1.
