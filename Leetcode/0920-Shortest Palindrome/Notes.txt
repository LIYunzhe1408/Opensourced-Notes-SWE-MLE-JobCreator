Intuition:
What ever this string is, we can always get a palindrome if we reverse this string.

KMP: largest overlap of prefix and suffix.


Pay attention that the letter is added at the beginning, but not at anywhere.
In this way, the index 0 will be the middle part of the final result. To determine
how many letters should be added, the solution is to find what's the length of palindrome we currently have.

So, find the longest palindrome starting from the index 0, then adding the rest part reversely.

Solutions:
1. Reverse the string, then compare the original one and the reversed one from longest to shortest.
