# Professional Biography
Personal biography is a common way to detail your professional story, demonstrating your achievements, credentials, and interests.
It is widely used on LinkedIn, your body paragraph of cover letter, personal statement, personal website, etc.

In this part, we will focus on the written biography.

Before drafting your first 200-word biography, some guiding questions are provided.
- How should I organize my story about myself for maximal impact?
- What would prospective employers and coworkers want to know about me?
- What about me might interest potential colleagues?
- What skills and experiences do I bring to projects and teams?
- What interests motivate my work?
- What kinds of professional biographies do I find inspiring, interesting, or memorable?

After the first draft, we need to pay attention to 3 key points to craft an engaging and persuasive bio.
- Desired Audience
- Tangible & Measurable Goals
- Format

## Format
Among these points, format is the first step to adjust. Examples are helpful for us to avoid common mistakes and guide us how to catch the audience.
