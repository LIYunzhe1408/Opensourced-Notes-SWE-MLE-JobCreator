"I need a structured review for a computer vision lecture, similar to my previous review for Lecture 1. The format should include:

Overview of the Topic (Brief introduction to the main focus of the lecture).
Key Equations & Mathematical Derivations (Step-by-step derivations with explanations).
Core Concepts & Theories (Clear definitions and conceptual breakdowns).
Industry Applications (Real-world use cases in robotics, self-driving cars, AR/VR).
Comparison Tables (If applicable, compare different models, methods, or transformations).
Visualization & Intuition Checks (Key diagrams, memory hacks, and intuition shortcuts).
Review & Retention Strategy (Active recall questions, Feynman technique, and spaced repetition tips).
Exam-Style Questions & Practice Problems (Mid-term style questions with short solutions).
Final Takeaways (Concise summary of what should be mastered for practical applications).
Ensure the review is concise, structured, and actionable, helping me bridge academia with industry applications."

Draw relationships between topics
