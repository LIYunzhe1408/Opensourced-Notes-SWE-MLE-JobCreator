# Install Unity and Complete [Tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/unity-essentials-install-unity-1?pathwayId=664b6225edbc2a01973f4f19&missionId=664bdda6edbc2a09177bccae#66509becedbc2a2cd2c75bff)
Due: September 5, 2024

1. First download Unity Hub at https://unity.com/download. A file will download named **UnityHubSetup.exe**
2. Launch the installer and follow the instruction to install and launch Unity Hub
3. Install the Unity Editor(**2022.3.43f1 LTS** for mine) as shown in the Unity Hub, which will take a while.
4. Download and open the [Unity Essentials Project](https://unity-connect-prd.storage.googleapis.com/20240813/5c857af5-ff52-4283-95b5-9798751e8501/Unity_Essentials_Download.zip) from Unity Hub.

## Editor Essentials
1. Unity Editor Windows:
    - Project Window: display files and assets
    - Hierarchy Window: show the scene structure
    - Scene View & Game View: navigate and edit & allow for real-time testing
    - Inspector window: provide detailed info
2. Navigate the Scene View
    - Press **F** key to frame the selected object
    - **Right mouse button + WASD** keys to enable flythrough mode
    - Press **alt** and click to orbit around an object
    - Perspective mode and Isometric mode (all objects are rendered at their actual size)
3. Move and Rotate
    - Press **W** key to activate **Move** tool
    - Press **E** key to activate **Rotate** tool

## 3D Essentials
1. Add instance of prefabs. and Transform component to position a GameObject
2. Create and edit own Material, use Physical Material, and add Rigidbody component.
      -  The **Transform** component sets position, rotation, and scale of the ball.
      -  The **Mesh Filter** component determines the shape of the GameObject by using 3D model mesh which is a wireframe.
      -  The **Mesh Render** controls the external appearance of the ball, we need to find the material applying to the ball.
      -  The **Sphere Collider** component defines the physical boundaries of GameObjects for collision purposes, relating to Physics Material.
      -  The **Mesh Collider** component adds physical properties for mesh.
      -  The **Rigidbody** component integrates the ball into Unity's physics system.
3. Arrange GameObjects in parent-child relationships and save it as prefabs.
4. Ctrl+Shift+F aligns the camera with my current view.
