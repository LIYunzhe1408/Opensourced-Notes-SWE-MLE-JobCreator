## Opportunity
### The Matthew Effect
1. People don't rise from nothing. We should unravel the logic behind who succeed and who doesn't.
2. Relative age. January 1 is the cutoff of age-class of Canada hockey, so those who were born in Jan to Mar have age advantage than others. Why?
    * Explanation: Elder in the same age class -> bigger&more coordinated&better maturity -> "rep" squad (all-star of 9&10) -> better coaching + better teammates + more games to play -> Major junior A League.
    * Proof: P20, P27
3. Accumulative advantages mean a lot. Start out just a little bit better.
### The 10,000 Hour Rule
1. Achievement is talent plus preparation(practice)
2. More chance to have practice. Mozart, Bill Joy, Bill Gates, Canadian hockey players, Beatles...
3. What truly distinguished successful outliers is not their extraordinary talent but their extraordinary opportunities.
4. Birth years count a lot.
   * Billionaires: Born in 1830-1839, 9 year window. Rail road and Wall Street emerged.
   * Veterans of Silicon Valley: Born in around 1955 as the personal computer revolution was January 1975.
     * Bill Gates: 1955
     * Paul Allen: 1953
     * Steve Ballmer: 1956
     * Steve Jobs: 1955
     * Eric Schmidt: 1955
     * Bill Joy: 1954
