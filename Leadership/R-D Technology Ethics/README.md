## Inventing and commercializing breakthroughs
Key concepts: "over the wall" friction, inventing and commercializing breakthroughs, R&D management, managing lone inventors, Edisonian vs. science-based methods of invention, how to measure success

Summary: Linda Choate's inventors have come up with a breakthrough in solar cell technology. Her manufacturing organization won't accept the technology, however, and her scientists are having difficulty working with the original inventor.

Reflection: It takes changes to make changes. The friction came up with the expansion of the silicon-based industry from glass manufacturing to semiconductor manufacturing, and then from manufacturing to research. All conflicts arise from changes. The only way to solve this is by changing the investment proportion and collaboration methods for each site.

Toledo: A site that encourages trials and errors and invents new products and processes by most engineers with no college degree. They prefer iterating in hands-on experience at a fast pace. They always rely on empirical methods and store practical knowledge with their brains instead of formal documenting.

Long Beach: A site that focuses on scale-up manufacturing and aims to optimize reproducing efficiency. They value standardized processes and formal documentation, while they view Toledo guys as risky for their empirical working style. It is typically a combination of scientific and practical.

Palo Alto: This site focuses on scientific research and values publications. They are regarded as disconnected from the real world.




## Managing star inventors and commercializing breakthroughs
Key concepts: Managing superstars, managing w/o non-competes, social networks and creativity
> **A non-compete agreement**, also known as a non-competition clause or deal, is a legal contract that prevents an employee from competing with their employer for a specific period after their employment ends. Non-compete agreements can also apply to contractors and former partners. These clauses in employment contracts restrict employees from working for competitors or starting their own businesses for a certain period of time after their employment ends. They are often criticized for limiting employees' future employment options and are illegal in some states.

> **Non-Disclosure Agreement**: These contracts protect confidential information, trade secrets, and proprietary knowledge from being revealed to competitors or third parties. NDAs don't restrict employees from working for competitors or starting their own businesses, but they do prohibit employees from sharing information about their work, such as client lists or information about products in development. NDAs are broader in scope than non-compete agreements and are more likely to be enforced by the court if proven.

Summary: Brandon Fogg's startup has had respectable but unspectacular success to date. Despite having hired outstanding research and manufacturing engineers, the firm is approaching the end of their financial runway, due mainly to problems in commercializing breakthrough ideas. Furthermore, Fogg’s best inventor seems oblivious to legal and conventional agreements on Intellectual Property.

Reflection: The patent says “you’re excluded.” It’s all about patent issues, which is related to invention, excluding others from not doing but NOT giving the right to do. If I do wanna sell something in the future, I will consider if it has a patent and whether I will be sued.
> Ask before use, sign before read.

Be cautious about the Not Invented Here synchrome that it would make us ignore external ideas and in favor of internally developed one. Though Riceman is an excellent inventor, none of its projects make revenue.



## Commercializing university breakthroughs (and acting professionally in your capstone projects)
Key concepts: University tech transfer, engineering vs. business attitudes, project problems, ethics.

Summary: Huang is a PhD student, and Anderson is a professor related to Huang’s project. Some MBA students got involved in this project through their course and made some miscommunication announcements that wrongly clarified their roles to clients. One of the professor’s students who is a CEO in a data science company talked about his experience.



Reflection: Many words but talks nothing. A concise presentation is expected. Students should engage more with their professors and ask permission before making any decisions for a collaborative project. Listening to the customer is important.(**LISTENING SKILLS**)


## AI: Future of Work
Key Concepts: Impact of AI on the workplace, employees, managers

Summary: For Robot Rumors the main question is whether you would eliminate some jobs in favor of using AI, or not, and how you would communicate that to current employees. You will write two email memos – to employees and to the Provost.

Reflection: AI accelerates intelligent workers. The employee should upskill and learn AI or GPT, positioning themselves as valuable assets. AI is a powerful tool for solving problems, and it is our humans that define a problem. As Einstein said if he had an hour, he would spend 55 min first defining the problem and the last 5 min to solve it, it’s more important to define a problem. These employees are experts in their field, they can well define a problem that aligns with the end users’ requirements and the market. AI is just an assistant to find a solution to the problem they define, accelerating the 5 min to 5 seconds. Plus, the position of a prompt engineer is crucial.
> AI is a simulation of human intelligence processes(learning+reasoning+self-correction) by machine or computer systems. ML focuses on developing algorithms for recognizing the hidden pattern of data, serving the system to make decisions.


## Autonomous Vehicle Companies and the ethics of automation safety
Key Concepts: Engineering ethics and professionalism, stakeholder analysis, AI vs. human decisions.

Summary: Different autonomous vehicle companies show different actions to ethical issues. Tesla is leading the trend and is emphasized to discuss.

Reflection: Tesla drives humans. As it is just a level-2 autonomous driving system announced in 2018, Tesla clearly stated their function and cautions for users. But the name of “autonomous” is somehow misleading. Regardless of some crash cases, Tesla performed well on a large scale, reducing death numbers on average compared to human drivers.
## Diversity and Inclusion in Technical Organizations
Key Concepts: Diversity in technical companies, company culture and retaining employees

Summary: Rosalind Fox is a successful woman working from an employee to the manager level. Based on her background and suffering biases, she has great resilience and adaptability to changing environments. As a manager, she fostered an inclusive collaborative working atmosphere.

Reflection: Everyone matters(introspect). Diversity can facilitate creative thinking and innovation, while may lead to less communication because of different cultures and languages. We need to find a balance between bringing authentic self and being mindful of the cultural norms as the former contributes to diversity and the latter is for working towards shared expectations.


## Leaving your current employer and starting your own firm
Key concepts: ethics, Intellectual property disclosure, non-competes, becoming an entrepreneur

Summary: Mason and Shepherd are working in their companies while having a new venture regarding the information of their current employer. This is a violation of the NDA.

Reflection: Read every word on the contract. Discussion with Jeremy Taylor, he suggested that if we engineers wanna do our own business, we just need to reach out to a law counselor company for help if we have legal problems.


## Engineering leadership in times of crisis
Key concepts: ethics and engineering leadership
Summary: Boeing rushed its production and recertification to compete with Airbus, while so many crashes happened due to the design of the angle of attack sensor, ill-trained pilots, and non-mention of the sensor in the manual.

Reflection: The board of a company should be diverse in order to make a comprehensive decision. Be clear about the industry rivalry which is the bargaining power supplier, the bargaining power of buyers, the substitute, and new entrants.
