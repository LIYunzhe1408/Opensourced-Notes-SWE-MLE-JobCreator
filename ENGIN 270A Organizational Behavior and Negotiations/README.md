# ENGIN 270A Organizational Behavior & Neogtiations




## Course success goal
Delivered on the first day, the goal is to arm ourselves to effectively navigate an organization and influence others, via implicit and explicit leadership. We will examine and apply organizational concepts & frameworks applicable within today’s companies—in order to secure project funding, drive cross-functional delivery, enable continuous improvement, and maximize others’ engagement.




## What do YOU bring to the table?
This day, Prof. Janel Wellborn launch the course by introducing the ability to connect with, and influence, your peers, your team, and your manager. The TRIAD framework and discussions with our manager in different stages are two contributions to key organizational behavior & negotiation behavior principles. You should read these takeaways if you are interested in influencing others as a leader or knowing what you bring to the table will set you up for individual, and collective, success.


Janel’s method introduces a frame called TRIAD, consisting of your manager, your team, your peers, and YOU at the core. In this TRIAD, you should connect differently with
- Youself: 
  * Lean into your strengths with humility 
  * Invest in continuous learning in the area of your strengths 
  * Be aware of your blind spots and surround yourself with people who can help mitigate them
- Your manager:
  - Ensure you have shared expectations around how to measure success 
  - Proactively create frequent 2-way feedback 
  - Understanding when and how to engage them, and what you can learn from them, and how you can best help cover their blindspots 
  - Understand their goals
- Your peers:
  - What’s their SME(subject matter expertise), and when should engage them 
  - What motivates them, and how are they incentivized, what are the KPIs 
  - What’s their sphere of functional ownership? 
  - What are their strengths and blind spots, any ying yang potential(supplementary)
- Your team 
  - What role do they need to play, how does it change? (situational leadership)
  - Know their individual strengths, and how you can set them up for success 
  - Which of your blind spots can they support? Looking for ying yang potential instead of clones 
  - How can you give them timely and actionable feedback


In a further development of collective success, we briefly dig deep into our manager, exploring something we can discuss as we’re interviewing for a job, as we onboard, and ongoing throughout our time in role with our manager.
- How are things going? Is there anything I could do to make a bigger, more positive impact on the org? - Ongoing
- If you think about a couple of folks who have been unsuccessful / successful in this org, what are some of their traits they have in common? - Interview for a perfect match
- What are your goals for this upcoming quarter? And how can I best support you in them - onboarding&ongoing
- Think forward to a year from now, what would I have done this 1st year that would make you refer to me as your “best ever hiring decision”? - Interview
- What’s keeping you up at night? How can I help? - interview & ongoing & onboarding
- When & how would you like to be engaged? What are the things that you want to stay close to vs. have me just run with it? - interview and onboarding


Now you are empowered the first step to influence others.




## Influence & Implicit Leadership
In today’s topic, Prof. Wellborn suggests that if we are to effectively influence or connect with our peers and stakeholders to develop cross-functional partnerships, we must delve into active listening and build trust & credibility based on organizational and negotiation principles.


Before building trust & credibility, Prof. Wellborn talked about the major differences between these two words that it takes more time to build trust than credibility. Trust is harder to articulate why you trust this person or not, making it intangible, while credibility is easier to explain why by demonstrating data, recommendations, and actions. The words listed below are features that support these two traits.
- Credibility: expertise, data, curiosity(things keep changing), listening
- Trust: humility, connection, gratitude, empathy


To make our connections drive our ability to influence, we dive deeper into a few of the tools.
1. Have a strong point of view, weakly held. By doing this, allowing our intuition and data we’ve collected to guide us to a conclusion, no matter how imperfect — this is the strong point of view. Then be open to others changing & challenging our opinions, looking for information that doesn’t fit, and practice active listening as you engage others with altering perspectives — this is the weakly held part. Eventually, our intuition will kick in and a new hypothesis will emerge out of the rubble.
2. Investigate the entire cube instead of a square. Invest the time and energy walking all around the cube, especially when you’re onboarding — it’s a learning mission where you should listen and learn what are goals, what’s important to them, what motivates them, what are they incentivized by, what do they need from you…
3. Ok to say no, but close the loop. Before saying NO to bad news, listen first, consider, research, poke around… Then close the loop on whether you can or cannot accommodate the request, and always explain why. Close the loop = response + explain


Now, practicing these tools to cultivate implicit leadership, and be aware that small actions can inspire others to come along with our mission to build trust and credibility.


## Driving alignment
In this topic, we learn how to listen actively and tell a strong narrative that moves people to drive lasting alignment.


First, be aware of Cross-Cultural Relationships, especially in a global workplace.


When we’re to drive alignment or develop a path forward, we need to know our audience and employ “WiiFM”(What’s in that for me) tactics by listening for pain points, for unmet needs, and for jobs to be done. To listen actively, we need to:
1. Practice empathy, seeing the data from the speaker’s perspective. 
2. Note the total meaning. Our emotions and feelings communicate as much. 
3. Note the non-verbal cues including tone of voice, clarity of speed, rate of speech, and whether they’re hesitate. 
4. Reflect back to the speaker what you heard to confirm with them.


A strong narrative moves people to action, getting people to see what you see. Storytelling is how you convey your idea in a way they can identify with it, they can relate to it, and they want to be a part of it. A common understanding of a product story allows(can) a team to incubate(cultivate) a shared vision. A story can go where quantitative analysis is denied admissions because data can persuade people, but it doesn’t inspire them to act.
> “Data may help you find the best path. Storytelling is how you get other humans to walk that path with you.” – Anna Marie Clifton


How to create a strong narrative?
- Use an analogy to relate it, and create a conflict that creates empathy
- Have a hero(our product) saving the day and bringing us to utopia.
- Depict a clear gap, a problem to solve, making what is now unappealing. From what is (reality) to what it could be, then the reality and another it could be…
- Involve in context, emotion, and how evidence(data) fits in.


Let’s wrap your vision into a story that fires the imagination and stirs the soul.


## Decision Making
In this topic, we learn to prioritize problems rather than solutions and evaluate ideas comprehensively with the OST framework to avoid several psychological hidden traps in our thinking when making a decision.


How to frame a problem has a huge influence on what types and quality of solutions we can come up with. Before figuring out how to do that, we first learn the Automatic system(act without conscious effect) and Effortful system(called upon in tough tasks) in neuroscience. In decision-making situations, we need to call the effortful system and critical thinking to recognize assumptions and biases.
> If I have an hour, I would spend 55 mins first defining a problem and the last five minutes solving it. – Einstein


A typical decision-making workflow is:
Assumptions - connections - arguments - expand all perspectives - evaluate - conclude
Eventually, coming up with an alignment. In this workflow, critical thinking can help us:
- Externalize our thinking, making transparent
- Examine our thinking, convincing yourself before you convince others
- Critique our thinking, not only welcoming challenges but insisting on it


It is easy to generate ideas, however, we expect the best idea. Before rushing to a decision, look for if there’s other alternatives that cost less effort. We are always trapped in the potential thinking gaps that fall in love with our ideas, don’t consider enough, don’t compare to pick the BEST idea, debate ideas rather than needs & opportunities… So always mapping solutions back to a need to choose based on data and make a decision using the Opportunity Solution Tree.
- Start with a desired and measurable outcome 
- Identify current gaps or frictions, these are opportunities 
- Brainstorm potential solutions 
- Design experiments that can help validate & decide

Slow down and use OST to evaluate ideas before rushing to a decision.





## Solving conflict
Conflict is a natural part of team building & collaboration. We need to be cognizant of it, and then minimize and prevent it from escalating rather than avoiding it altogether.


To better understand how to handle conflicts, Tuckman’s model is introduced to show phases of team development.
- Team members talked about different ideas in the STORMING phase where team effectiveness might be lowered but holds potential for further collaboration. In a big team or an organization, there may be just 1-2 people do this to collect members’ ideas. 
- After performing well, most current teams probably stop there and start from the beginning for another project. Instead of this, working with the same team on another project can save time and sustain effectiveness.

How to handle different ideas is difficult, Thomas-Kilmann proposed a conflict model. Assertive means one person shows confidence in the idea. This model can be regarded as a strategy for conflict management.

Additionally, listening to others is of vital importance because we need to keep in mind that what we say, what others’ hear, and what we really mean are totally different which frequently causes conflicts.




## Building a high-functioning team
Cognitive diversity refers to the variety of ways people think, including how they process information, view the world, and make decisions. A cognitively diverse and inclusive team is more likely to meet financial targets, be high-performing, innovative and agile, and achieve better business outcomes.
![](/high-functioning team.png)

Before building this team, we need to foster an inclusive environment that demonstrates psychological safety.
> This is a situation where everyone is safe to take risks, voice their thoughts, and ask judgment-free questions. A culture where managers provide air cover and create safe zones so employees can let down their guard.


Three metrics can be used to measure trust.

$$\frac{credibility+relibility+intimacy}{self-centric}$$

Where credibility means they know stuff, reliability means they deliver when they say they will, intimacy means I feel safe with them, and self-centric means are they focused more on their perspectives or mine.


2 tools we can use in our capstone projects:
- Team charter:
  - Purpose: why does this team exist 
  - Accountabilities: what is our team on the hook for 
  - Decision rights: what choices can we make without approval 
  - Metrics: what data will we use to steer our work
- Working agreements 
  - What are the norms around how we meet 
  - How do we want to use async collaboration tools 
  - How do we think about availability and response time 
  - What is unclear and should be made explicit


Feedback loops and continuous improvement
- As a team: make time for regular retrospectives 
  - What’s working 
  - What’s working ok but could be better 
  - What’s not working 
- As individuals: ask for feedback 
  - What can I start doing 
  - What should I stop doing 
  - What should I continue doing




## Effective job seeking/interview/onboarding
The best source of candidates is from existing employees, these referrals often lead to the best long-term fit.

In many cases, we can learn the most about a candidate by the questions they ask.
Looking for a FIT BY ASKING QUESTIONS rather than saying nothing about the question part. Effective questions:
- Vision 
- Important skills 
- D2d support 
- Mentorship 
- Passion 
- Expectation 
- Why chose this job 
- Growth opportunity
Priority tier 2 questions can be asked in the follow-up email after or before the interview.


Closing the loop
I don’t know, but I will find ways for it.


Salary negotiation =
- budget fit 
- whether you have done enough research 
- whether you know the market well 
- What’s your range 
Try not to ANSWER right away until understand the role.


Effective communication
Drawing a snowman, a bike, and then a man with a guitar.
- Giving instruction without seeing the feedback can work in simple tasks only. 
- Giving instruction with simple answers of yes or no improves a little. 
- Giving instruction with detailed answers works the best.
