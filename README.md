### [OpenCV for beginners](OpenCV-Beginner/) - Completed at July 27 2024
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is crucial to learn because it provides a comprehensive and efficient collection of algorithms for computer vision and image processing tasks. Its extensive functionality enables developers to perform complex tasks such as object detection, face recognition, and image transformations with relative ease. OpenCV's wide adoption in both academic research and industry projects makes it a valuable tool for anyone pursuing a career in machine learning, deep learning, or computer vision, ensuring that the skills acquired are both practical and highly relevant to current technological demands.

### [Git](Git/) - Completed at July 27 2024
Learning Git is crucial because it is the most widely used version control system in the software industry, enabling efficient collaboration and management of code changes. With Git, multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work, track changes to the codebase over time, and easily revert to previous versions if needed. Mastering Git ensures smoother project workflows, better code quality, and is an essential skill for professional development in any software-related field.

### [Product Management](Product%20Management-Book%20review-From%20the%20idea%20to%20the%20product) - Completed at August 26 2024
> This is a book review. Book author: Fei Liu

The original Chinese version is now available [here.](Product%20Management-Book%20review-From%20the%20idea%20to%20the%20product/ChineseVersion.md)

This book, from the perspective of a product manager, introduces the values and practical methodologies that a product manager needs throughout the entire cycle from idea to product. It helps better define product features, analyze requirements, foster team collaboration, and manage updates and iterations. In my view, this not only aids product managers in quickly getting started but also serves as a valuable supplement of soft skills for tech professionals, entrepreneurs, and student team leaders. It broadens their approach to considering problems, thinking through issues, and finding solutions. If you’re looking for a roadmap to turn ideas into products, this book offers a comprehensive approach from conceptualizing ideas to creating actionable plans, along with management and collaboration techniques for producing usable products.

#### Takeaways
1. An idea alone does not have inherent value. A feature described in a single sentence is meaningless. Ideas should be refined into detailed plans with robust product models and business strategies that are scalable and feasible within the team's capabilities.
2. Good products address actual user problems rather than just keeping users engaged. Creating value for users is essential. In Silicon Valley, many entrepreneurs decide to start a business first and then determine what to do. What keeps you motivated is knowing that what you’re working on is creating real value.
3. Product models and core feature design guide the product, while MVP is the practical methodology. Avoid over-designing a complex and unrealistic solution. The first step should be taken quickly to test whether the idea is valid. MVPs often need adjustment based on feedback and findings, and the early product design should focus on simplification. Completing the process does not necessarily require a full online launch.
4. Use first principles to understand the essence of needs, rather than comparing with others' solutions, which only leads to incremental iterations. User research quality is measured by its support for product optimization. Be cautious of data traps in quantitative research and seek to understand underlying reasons in qualitative research. Becoming a user yourself is the best research method.
5. There is always room for improvement in any feature. Good products are not dependent on a single innovative idea but on meticulous attention to detail. Any aspect that feels potentially uncomfortable could cause widespread dissatisfaction.
6. Product managers should understand technology to better design functions and collaborate, not to perform technical tasks. Good documentation is logical, complete, and describes background and principles of requirement realization.
7. Continuously ask yourself: Am I doing the right things? Am I using effective methods? What can I do to improve efficiency?
8. Treat all work-related matters as problems to be solved, which helps cultivating structural thinking and clearly identify and address each issue's status. Structured thinking also helps depersonalize emotional problems.
9. Basic communication skills involve understanding and conveying information clearly. Advanced skills ensure that communication issues are not affected by emotions or mindsets. Top-level communication skills not only facilitate information exchange but also leverage opportunities to achieve goals and enhance work through others.
10. Organize and structure your knowledge and materials, treating yourself as a product to be iterated and improved.
11. A good product aims to make the world a better place. Internally, we should have ambitious goals while being grounded in practical work.
12. Reading alone does not lead to mastery. Applying what you learn to your situation, absorbing and practicing it, is what drives growth. Aim for a balance of ambitious vision and practical action to make significant contributions.
