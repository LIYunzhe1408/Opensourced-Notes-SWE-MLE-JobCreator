With Git, multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work, track changes to the codebase over time, and easily revert to previous versions if needed. Mastering Git ensures smoother project workflows, better code quality, and is an essential skill for professional development in any software-related field.|
| [Unity](Technical%20Skills/Unity/)                                                                           | <span style="color:green"> **Closed**  | Unity is a real-time 3D development platform used to create and launch games, simulations, and other interactive experiences. |

Whether describing key trends in science and tech, advocating for developments in our field of specialty, or chronicling our own professional journey, we will learn how to promote our groundbreaking ideas across forums and formats. |
| [Project Management](/Leadership/Teaming%20and%20Project%20Management/)                | <span style="color:green"> **Closed**      |
| [Organizational Behavior & Negotiations](/Leadership/Organizational%20Behavior%20and%20Negotiations/)  | <span style="color:green"> **Closed**  | The ability to effectively navigate an organization and influence others is critical for those aspiring to leadership positions in virtually any field – in order to secure project funding, drive cross-functional delivery, enable continuous improvement, and maximize employee engagement. **Notes** 1.  Having a strong point of view, weakly held. 2.  Ok to say I don't know, but close the loop. 3.  Reflect back to the speaker what you heard to confirm. 4.  Data can persuade people, but it doesn’t inspire them to act. The story can. 5.  Using the Opportunity-Solution Tree to externalize our thinking, examining our thinking, and critiquing our thinking. 6.  Embrace diversity to cover our blind spots. |
| [R&D Technology Management & Ethics](/Leadership/R-D%20Technology%20Ethics/)        | <span style="color:green"> **Closed**  | We are empowered with the proficiency in verbal leadership, through discussions of technology and business case studies. **Notes** 1.  Ask before use, read before sign. 2.  The patent excludes others from not doing but not gives anyone the right to do. 3.  AI accelerates the 5 mins to 5 seconds to solve a problem, but it still needs 55 mins of human to define a problem. 4.  Diversity can facilitate creative thinking, we should bring the authentic self and being mindful of the cultural norms. 5.  Read every word on the contract. 6.  Be clear about the industry rivalries. 7.  Meet more people, build more connections, and embrace the cohort. |
| [Product Management](/Reading/Product%20Management-Book%20review-From%20the%20idea%20to%20the%20product/)           | <span style="color:green"> **Closed**  | The original Chinese version is now available [here.](/Reading/Product%20Management-Book%20review-From%20the%20idea%20to%20the%20product/ChineseVersion.md).  This book, from the perspective of a product manager, introduces the values and practical methodologies that a product manager needs throughout the entire cycle from idea to product. It helps better define product features, analyze requirements, foster team collaboration, and manage updates and iterations. **Notes** 1. An idea alone does not have inherent value. Ideas should be refined into detailed plans with robust product models and business strategies that are scalable and feasible within the team's capabilities. 2. Good products address actual user problems rather than just keeping users engaged. In Silicon Valley, many entrepreneurs decide to start a business first and then determine what to do. 3. Product models and core feature design guide the product, while MVP is the practical methodology. Avoid over-designing a complex and unrealistic solution at the first step. 4. Use first principles to understand the essence of needs, rather than comparing with others' solutions, which only leads to incremental iterations. 5. Continuously ask yourself: Am I doing the right things? Am I using effective methods? What can I do to improve efficiency? 6. Treat all work-related matters as problems to be solved, which helps cultivating structural thinking and clearly identify and address each issue's status. 7. Basic communication skills involve understanding and conveying information clearly. Advanced skills ensure that communication issues are not affected by emotions or mindsets. Top-level communication skills not only facilitate information exchange but also leverage opportunities to achieve goals and enhance work through others. 8.  Organize and structure your knowledge and materials, treating yourself as a product to be iterated and improved. 9.  A good product aims to make the world a better place. Internally, we should have ambitious goals while being grounded in practical work.
