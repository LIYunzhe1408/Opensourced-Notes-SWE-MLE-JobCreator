## Crack the interview
1. High priority - Dive deep into your resume(mind map, flowchart, etc)
2. High priority - Coding
3. Low priority - CS fundamentals
4. Mid priority - Behaviorial Questions
5. [Optional] ML fundamentals

### Dive deep into your resume
Suppose you have included your related experience in your resume, you will be likekly to be asked about these previous experience. It's valuable to review these experience, especially the skill you used, the product you developed, what you learned, to answer technical questions and even behavioral questions in the interview.

The first step is to know what STAR method is, which is useful to organize your words to tell an engaging story especially for those who's not native English speaker. STAR stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result. 
* Situation will provide context to your audiencce about you are talking about. When the interviewer asked about one specific experience no matter it's a work experience, project, or research, it's always a good idea to start with "The context of this project is solving xxx problem", "In xxx field, xxx is a probem, my work is xxx.".
* Task will pivot a central point you want to achieve, give the interviewer a teaser what will be the expectation. For example, "my task was to develop a xxx to xxx", "my task was to reduce/increase/improve xxx" are clear statement and can also be related to what you wrote in your resume.
* Action part will help you list concrete steps how you finish the task. Examples can be like, "Then I take several actions, first, I reached out to xxx. Then I figured out xxx. After that, I developed xxx." These steps can be as an extension of your description of your resume bullet points. It is also helpful to demonstrate you have clear logic about what you are saying.
* Result again reflects your amazing impact. You can simply end up with saying, "As a result, we recude/improve xxx by xxx%", or, "As a result, we implemented xxx and it helped boosting xxx revenue."

After reading the STAR, we can dive deep into our resume using it. You can use whatever tools you like, hand drawing, xmind, or etc, to create this flowchart. I recommend to use draw.io. All you need is to create 4 blocks representing Situation, Task, Action, and Result. Then going through every experience one by one, and fill in the blocks for each experience. As you did the minimal version of one of your projects, you can extend each block(usually the action block) as much as you wish. Like, you can ask GPT to give you some example questions regarding to this flowchart that the interviewer would ask. Add stuff being asked but you are not familiar with as an extended block.
Finally you will have a informational graph which you can practice interview questions regarding to one specific experience. You are free to refer to this "cheatsheet" at early stage, when you repeated for several times, you would be feel comfortable to explain all on the graph in your own words

Then, move on to next experience. You will stumble your voice in some experience, then it would be a good time to iterate your resume. Usually, during one interview, the interviewer will ask at most revelant 3 experience for the sake of time.

### Coding
Working is a collaborative task, you are expected to be a team player rather than a solo guy. Interaction is all you need during a coding process. As a new grad, you are typically asked questions to screen your logic and communication skills rather than system design. Suppose you have learned how to program, I will start from how to convert your solo programming skill into real-work scenario programming skill. It's common forgeting principles of what stack is, what tree is, it's recommended to review these stuff from this [study plan](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-study-plan/) combined what I will introduce below.

Here's the persudo code for what I did
``` python
# Breadth-wise
For topic in topics:
  Review the fundamentals and take some notes. Goal is to recall what you have previously learnt and how to use technique.
  Work on essential questions. May be 1 or 2 per day.
  For essential question in essential questions:
    Set a 15 min timer, While in 15 min
      Try to solve the question
    Stop coding NO MATTER YOU SOLVED IT OR NOT and search this problem at youtube using "[problem name] + neetcode"
    Neetcode provide clear solution and explanation
    Understand how neetcode solved it, try to repeat his explanation.
    Close the video, clear the code you wrote, try to do what neetcode did in the coding part with explaining yourself.
    [Optional: Record a video and review yourself to see if it's clear, publish on YouTube]
    [See examples here](https://youtu.be/YUXLl-NqL24?si=h_ocVbkfXHOxpaF_)
    Create a sheet documenting this question pattern, how you solved it, and solved date.
  Review 1 question that is least reviewed.

# Depth-wise
For topic in topics:
  For recommended question in recommended questions:
    Repeat the same process as before.
