## Technical Skills
### [OpenCV for beginners](OpenCV-Beginner/) - Last Updated: July 25 2024
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is crucial to learn because it provides a comprehensive and efficient collection of algorithms for computer vision and image processing tasks. Its extensive functionality enables developers to perform complex tasks such as object detection, face recognition, and image transformations with relative ease. OpenCV's wide adoption in both academic research and industry projects makes it a valuable tool for anyone pursuing a career in machine learning, deep learning, or computer vision, ensuring that the skills acquired are both practical and highly relevant to current technological demands.
### [Git](Git/) - Last Updated: July 27 2024
Learning Git is crucial because it is the most widely used version control system in the software industry, enabling efficient collaboration and management of code changes. With Git, multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work, track changes to the codebase over time, and easily revert to previous versions if needed. Mastering Git ensures smoother project workflows, better code quality, and is an essential skill for professional development in any software-related field.

The original Chinese version is now available [here.](Product%20Management-Book%20review-From%20the%20idea%20to%20the%20product/ChineseVersion.md)

This book, from the perspective of a product manager, introduces the values and practical methodologies that a product manager needs throughout the entire cycle from idea to product. It helps better define product features, analyze requirements, foster team collaboration, and manage updates and iterations. In my view, this not only aids product managers in quickly getting started but also serves as a valuable supplement of soft skills for tech professionals, entrepreneurs, and student team leaders. It broadens their approach to considering problems, thinking through issues, and finding solutions. If you’re looking for a roadmap to turn ideas into products, this book offers a comprehensive approach from conceptualizing ideas to creating actionable plans, along with management and collaboration techniques for producing usable products.
