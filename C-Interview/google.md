## Introduce myself
Hi, my name is Jonas. I’m currently a Machine Learning Engineer at WeRide, which is a robotaxi company similar to Waymo. My current work focuses on developing real-time detection models for production-level AiDrive System and leveraging vision language models for offline large-scale data mining.

Before that, I interned at Momenta, another self-driving company that focuses more on assisted-driving systems, similar to Tesla’s Autopilot. During the internship, I helped deliver the first version of the reversing feature for GM Cadillac vehicles, and i engaged in the entire lifecycle of this feature.

I received my master’s degree in Computer Science from UC Berkeley, and my bachelor’s degree from Shanghai University. Over the past seven to eight years, I’ve been deeply involved in robotics and computer vision, starting from building real-time perception pipelines for mobile robots in competitions like FIRST Tech Challenge in high school and DJI RoboMaster in undergrad.

Those team experiences taught me how exciting it is to build something meaningful with others and see it actually work in the real world. That’s also why I’m really excited about Google — to contribute to large-scale, impactful products that can reach millions of users.


## Why leave and Why google
“That’s a great question.”

I’ve really appreciated my time at WeRide, where I’ve learned a lot about developing production-level perception systems, optimizing large-scale data pipelines, and working in fast-paced engineering teams. These experiences have taught me how to build machine learning systems that handle complex, real-world data under real-time constraints.

But over time, I’ve realized I want to work on problems with even broader impact, especially where ML models can directly shape products used by millions of people. That’s what draws me to Google.

I’m particularly inspired by how Google applies large-scale machine to everyday products like Maps, Search, and Gemini. Acutally, using Gemini in Colab has been eye-opening for me, i think it's not only a powerful debugging tool for engineers, but it also serves as a great learning resource for coding beginners. Like, my younger brother, who’s just starting to learn programming in high school, can simply ask Gemini questions in the Colab notebook itself instead of googling across websites like we used to. I’d love to contribute to that kind of meaningful product.

What also excites me is Google’s engineering excellence and its diverse culture. I believe that when people from different backgrounds come together, innovative ideas emerge more naturally. With my background in autonomous driving and real-time perception, I hope to bring a unique perspective to the team and contribute meaningfully to Google’s mission.
