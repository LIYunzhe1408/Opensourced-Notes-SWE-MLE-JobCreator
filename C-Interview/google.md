## Introduce myself
My name is Jonas, i'm currently a machine learning engineer at WeRide, which is a Robotaxi company just like Waymo did. My current focus is developing real-time detection model for mass production and utilizing Large Language model for offline data mining. I also interned at Momenta, which is also an self-driving company but focus on assisting driving system like tesla autopilot did. My work was to help deliver the first version reversing feature for GM Cadellic. I received my master's degree from UC Berkeley, majoring in computer science, and my bachelor's degree from Shanghai University. So during the past 7-8 years before entering the industry, i started to develop real-time perception pipelines for robots with omnidirectional chassis to perform moving and manipulating task in a filed. Bascially the FIRST Tech Challenge in high school and RoboMaster in undergrad. I participated in these 2 competitions in my full high school and undergrad years, they are team works, and i feel it was very dope to create something with a team and truly bring to the world and possibly benefit people. That's also the reason why i want to join Google to make big.

Hi, my name is Jonas. I’m currently a Machine Learning Engineer at WeRide, a leading robotaxi company similar to Waymo. My current work focuses on developing real-time detection models for mass-production deployment and leveraging large language models for large-scale offline data mining.

Before that, I interned at Momenta, another self-driving company that focuses more on assisted-driving systems, similar to Tesla’s Autopilot. I helped deliver the first version of the reversing feature for GM Cadillac vehicles.

I received my master’s degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from UC Berkeley, and my bachelor’s degree from Shanghai University. Over the past seven to eight years, I’ve been deeply involved in robotics and computer vision, starting from building real-time perception pipelines for mobile robots in competitions like FIRST Tech Challenge in high school and DJI RoboMaster in undergrad.

Those team experiences taught me how exciting it is to build something meaningful with others and see it actually work in the real world. That’s also why I’m really excited about Google — to contribute to large-scale, impactful products that can reach millions of users.


## Why leave and Why google
That’s a great question. I’ve really appreciated my time at WeRide — I’ve learned a lot about developing production-level perception systems, optimizing large-scale data pipelines, and collaborating in fast-paced engineering teams.

But over time, I’ve realized I want to work on problems with even broader impact and complexity — especially where machine learning models can directly influence products used by millions of people.

Google’s environment — from the scale of data and infrastructure to the open research culture — really matches how I want to grow next. I want to apply my experience in real-time perception and model deployment to problems that combine large-scale ML, multimodal understanding, and real-world impact. I feel that’s where my interests and skills can truly expand to the next level.
