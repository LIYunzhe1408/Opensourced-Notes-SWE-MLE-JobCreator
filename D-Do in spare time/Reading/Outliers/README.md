## Opportunity
### The Matthew Effect
1. People don't rise from nothing. We should unravel the logic behind who succeed and who doesn't.
2. Relative age. January 1 is the cutoff of age-class of Canada hockey, so those who were born in Jan to Mar have age advantage than others. Why?
    * Explanation: Elder in the same age class -> bigger&more coordinated&better maturity -> "rep" squad (all-star of 9&10) -> better coaching + better teammates + more games to play -> Major junior A League.
    * Proof: P20, P27
3. Accumulative advantages mean a lot. Start out just a little bit better.
### The 10,000 Hour Rule
1. Achievement is talent plus preparation(practice)
2. More chance to have practice. Mozart, Bill Joy, Bill Gates, Canadian hockey players, Beatles...
3. What truly distinguished successful outliers is not their extraordinary talent but their extraordinary opportunities.
4. Birth years count a lot.
   * Billionaires: Born in 1830-1839, 9 year window. Rail road and Wall Street emerged.
   * Veterans of Silicon Valley: Born in around 1955 as the personal computer revolution was January 1975.
     * Bill Gates: 1955
     * Paul Allen: 1953
     * Steve Ballmer: 1956
     * Steve Jobs: 1955
     * Eric Schmidt: 1955
     * Bill Joy: 1954
### The Trouble With Genius
1. A boy's IQ does a little help if he is faced with a formful of clever boys.
2. IQ test shows the threshold regions on IQ's scale, determining that when past a certain point higher or lower counts less.
3. Convergence test -> analytical, divergence test -> creativity
4. Intelligence and achievements are far from correlated.
5. General intelligence and practical intelligence are orthogonal
6. Parenting style of concerted cultivation V.S. accomplishment of natural growth. The former one make child learning teamwork, how to cope in highly structured settings, how to interact comfortably with adults, how to speak up when she needs to. It's somehow a sense of entitlement which means the child has the right to pursue their own individual preference and to actively manage interactions in institutional settings.
   e.g. Robert Oppenheimer V.S. Chris Langan
7. The community around children will prepare them properly or improperly for the world.

### The Three Lessons of Joe Flom
* Jewish immigrations -> Hard Work and Persistence
* Perfect birth date -> blessedly small generation
* Family garment industry / Meaningful work(autonomy + complexity + effort&reward) -> boot camp for professions in persuasion & initiative & market search

## Legacy
### Harlan, Kentucky
* Cultural legacy means a lot, with the example of fighting over honor and reaction experiments of northerners and southerners under insulting
* The tradition and attitudes we inherit from our forebears can play the same role.

### The ethnic theory of plane crashes
* Crashes are much more likely to be the result of an accumulation of minor difficulties and trivial malfunctions.
* Cultural legacy affect intention to speak up and challenge others when he finds something wrong. Individualism-collectivism scale(Hofstede's Dimension) and Power distance index are introduced.
* Pilots of Korean Airlines conducted social behavior and actions in the order of seniority or ranking. But hints are dangerous, they need commands.
* There's no time unwinding underlying meaning of what others said. Speaker(generally take obligations in western) should speak up clearly and receivers(generally take obligations to unwind speakers' words) should not unwind meanings.
* Those who are stuck in culture traps should be taken out and re-normed.
* It is one thing to learn that in a classroom, and quite another to actually do it in the air.

### Rice Paddies and Math tests
Background: rice paddies is a complex system of dikes and has to be built(not opened up) around the field. Factors like trade-off between yield and how quickly it grew, how well it did in times of drought, how it fared in poor soil offer a slight difference to choose from.
* Number-naming system is different in Western and Asian languages where the one in English is highly irregular, and the one in Asia is more logical. It helps asian students to learn faster. Then enjoy maths -> work harder -> have more classes -> more willing to do homework -> virtuous circle.
* Being good at maths or not is rooted in a group's culture(legacy), doing nothing with IQ level.
* A comparison between diligent peasants in China who work 3,000 hours a year and !Kung men and Europe men.
* The life of a rice farmer, like the garment in NY that Jewish did, is meaningful
  * There's a clear relationship between effort and reward, work more, get more.
  * Complex
  * Autonomous that the social system in EU was not likely supporting(low-paid slaves), Chinese peasants paid fixed rent fee regardless of harvest. -> did good + extra income
* Example of a nurse spending 22 minutes on a math problem, persisting and figuring it out eventually.
  * Success = persistence + doggedness + willingness to make sense of something
* Cultural legacy shaped traits that affect a lot.

### Marita's Bargain
1. over-study -> rest to enhance cognitive and analytical ability ^ conflict with asian's paddy(more plot more got) because the western rhythm of the agriculture season -> long summer vacation
   * Insanity
   * Mental disorder
2. Kids in KIPP spend 50-60% more time learning than the traditional public school student
3. More time in class will lead to:
   * teacher can explain more things
   * students can digest everything that's going on with better understanding and greater retention in slower pace
   * **To let students see clear relationship between effort and reward**
   * Get up early and spend more time in school.
4. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities and who have the strength and presence of mind to seize them.

### A Jamaican Story
1. The success of outliers are products of history and community, of opportunities and legacy.
