# Overview
This project is based on [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) on Coursera.
We summarize some general ideas and useful tricks, and most importantly, formulate some common workflow for daily usage.
The notes are publicly open-sourced on the [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_6jfaFTvCogWSddtzJZXsP9a-MidRb5j?usp=sharing),
feel free to browse it and make some comments if there are any suggestions or errors.

Git is a powerful tool for version control, especially in multi-collaborator scenarios. Practice is the first priority.
One page summary serves as a quick-access personal wiki, not granting for a deep tutorial. 

This project is finished. Some updates might be done in the future.
Documents in the Google drive will be always available until the updates happen here.
